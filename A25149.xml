            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Which (is humbly conceived) cannot be prevented any other way than by laying ſuch an additional Duty on Tin Exported, that it may come ſo much the dearer to them, as may ballance their gains by Allay.</p>

                  </label> This is but barely alledged, and cannot be demonſtrated; but the contrary may be made appear, That Tin will not only bear the return of the Duty of 4 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> the Hundred, but yet 'tis manifeſt to the moſt experienced Men in that Trade, that the Demand for it there is ſo great, that it will yield in <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> and other Countries beyond the <hi>Cape of Good Hope,</hi> from 3 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s.</hi> to 5 <hi>l.</hi> the Hundred Weight; and therefore impracticable to bring it into <hi>Europe</hi> as Merchandize: Though ſometimes when no better Kentilage can be got, ſome ſmall quantity is brought as Ballaſt to ſtiffen the Ship, and can be neither more or leſs, by laying and Additional Duty of 8 or 10 <hi>s.</hi> the Hundred Weight on our Tin exported: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, 'tis not ſo good in Quality as ours, for the <hi>Dutch</hi> give 3 or 4 <hi>s.</hi> the Hundred Weight more for the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> than the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Tin at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>And 'tis evident ſuch an Additional Duty, will not ſo advance the Price of Tin, as to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Foreign vent of it; either by diſcouraging the Uſe, or Conſumption of it, in Foreign Countries, or by encouraging them, to bring Tin from <hi>Eaſt-India:</hi> For ſince the taking off the Duty the laſt Parliament; the Tinner hath advanced the Price of Tin, near 20 <hi>s.</hi> the Hundred to the Foreigner, as well to as our own Subjects: The Tinners Price being then but 48, or 50 <hi>s.</hi> the Hundred; and the laſt <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

So that 'tis plain that 8, or 10 <hi>s.</hi> the Hundred, Additional Duty, will not diſcourage the Foreign Vent of Tin; ſince that will not advance the Price to the Foreigner one half ſo much as the Tinner or Merchants hath advanced it, ſince the taking off the Duty.</p>
               <p>And the difference only is, that the Duty is to the King and for the good of the Publick, and the 20 <hi>s. per</hi> Hundred, now advanced in Price, is to the private Gain and Advantage of the Tinner and Merchant, who make this Objection againſt the Return and Increaſe of the Duty; which is not only much to the Kings Advantage, but alſo the only remedy for the Pewterers Grievance.</p>
